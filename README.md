# Project_0_F25
In this lab, you will be learning about git and some of the features of git and GitHub. A part of the lab will be to clone this repository to your system and and then make changes to the repository. (Do not work in this repository). The attached simple source file print_random_string.c is to be modified by you to include a function that implements the rand_string() function. See the instructions in the GitHW file

This program takes a defined size value and randomly generates a string of that size. Each randomly generated letter and the resulting string's formation can be found within the random.c file.
